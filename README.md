# UrlConverter

![Settings Window](https://raw.github.com/paddysal/UrlConverter/master/URLConverterPromo.png)

Program for converting url's, by default works by modifying age restricted videos on youtube so that they can be viewed without signing in. This is because I very rarely sign in to youtube therefore I prefer to use this piece of code to see the video rather than search for my notepad with the password for youtube.

Program consists off 1 class that when ran lanuches Swing frame on which you operate.
Top text box gets filled in by your clipboard, therefore anything you copy will be automatically placed in the text box at the top. By default the copied value will be treated as a youtube link, but if you have other websites on which you would like to be able to modify links then you can either let me know and I will implement the option to do so by default or you can use the Add Rule button to add as many new rules as you want. Just be aware that the parts of URL you would like to get removed have to be typed using Regex patterns.

Disclaimer: Free to use by anyone.
